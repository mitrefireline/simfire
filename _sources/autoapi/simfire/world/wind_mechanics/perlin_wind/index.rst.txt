.. py:class:: WindNoise(seed = None, scale = 100, octaves = 2, persistence = 0.5, lacunarity = 1.0)

   Class for controlling and fine tuning wind noise generation with the Simplex noise
   algorithm

   Class that handles and creates the wind layer which specifies the magnitude
   and direction of wind a a given location.  Uses python noise library

   :param seed: The value to seed the noise generator
   :param scale: The "altitude" from which to see the noise
   :param octaves: number of passes/layers of the algorithm.  Each pass adds more detail
   :param persistence: How much each pass affects the overall shape
                       High values means each pass is less important on shape.
                       Lower values mean each pass has greater effect on shape.
                       Best to keep between 0-1
   :param lacunarity: Controls increase in frequency of octaves per pass.
                      Frequency = lacunarity & (pass number).
                      Higher lacunarity, higher frequency per pass.
   :param screen_size: Size of screen (both heigh and width) MUST BE SQUARE
