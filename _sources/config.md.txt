# Configuring the Simulation

The configuration for SimFire is all done through a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file. All of the configurable settings will be explained in the sections below.

This file can have any name, as a path is required to load the configuration file, but the hierarchy of the file must match the hierarchy found in the example [`config.yml`](https://gitlab.mitre.org/fireline/simfire/-/blob/main/config.yml). This example configuration can be seen in its entirety at the [bottom of this page](#example-config-file).

## Settings

---

### Area Parameters

```{attention}
These parameters will be overwritten if you are using the "[Operational](#operational-parameters)" data.
```

#### screen_size
(`Tuple[int, int]`)<br>
Determines how large the simulation is in pixels. The `screen_size` sets both the height and the width of the screen.

#### pixel_scale
(`float`)<br>
The number of feet across that one pixel represents. i.e. for the default value, one pixel represents a 50ft x 50ft square of land.

---

### Display Parameters

#### fire_size
(`int`)<br>
The size of the flame/fire size in pixels. Only used for display purposes, and does not change fire dynamics.

#### control_line_size
(`int`)<br>
The size of the control lines in pixels. Only used for display purposes, and does not change how much space the control line takes up in the simulation.

#### agent_size
(`int`)<br>
The size of the agent(s) in pixels. Only used for display purposes, and does not change how much space the agent takes up in the simulation.

#### rescale_factor
(`int`)<br>
The factor to increase the height and width of the screen for display purposes only.

---

### Simulation Parameters

#### update_rate
(`float`)<br>
The number of minutes that each game/frame update represents in simulation time. Note that this can be fractional to account for times that are non-integer and/or less than 1.

#### runtime
(`str`)<br>
The amount of time that the simulation is supposed to run. This can be expressed in days, hours, and minutes in any of the following ways and more: `2d`, `2day`, `2days`, `24h`, `1d 23h 60m`, etc. If no designation is given or if the value is given with a space in between the integer and the time span (e.g. `2 days`), the program will assume the units are in minutes.

#### headless
(`bool`)<br>
Whether or not to run the simulation in a headless state.

#### sf_home
(`str`)<br>
Where to save the LandFire operational data, GIF recordings, and burn graphs of simulation [runs](https://fireline.pages.mitre.org/simfire/autoapi/simfire/sim/simulation/index.html#simfire.sim.simulation.FireSimulation.run). It will create subfolders in `sf_home` that are called `landfire`, `gifs`, and `graphs`. This can be overriden for GIFs and burn graphs in individual function calls for `save_gif` and `save_spread_graph`. This will also set the environment variable `SF_HOME` to the same value.

#### draw_spread_graph
(`bool`)<br>


#### record
(`bool`)<br>

#### save_data
(`bool`)<br>

#### data_type
(`str`)<br>
The format to save the data of the simulation. Can by type: "npy", "h5".

---

### Mitigation Parameters

#### ros_attenuation
(`bool`)<br>
Whether or not to attenuate rate of spread based on the type of line being used. These attenuation values can be seen in [`enums.py`](https://gitlab.mitre.org/fireline/simfire/-/blob/main/simfire/enums.py#L48). These values will be subtracted from the rate of spread for a given pixel based on the control line type. If this value is set to `false`, all lines will completely stop a fire and the rate of spread for any pixel with a control line will be set to zero.

---

### Operational Parameters
These are the operational parameters that will be used for the operational data layers that rely on a location, if those layers' types are set to `operational`.

```{attention}
If using operational data, this will overwrite the values set in the [Area Parameters](#area-parameters) section, as the height, width, and resolution set here will take precedence.
```

#### seed
(`int`)<br>
The seed that would pick a random latitude and longitude. Leave empty if using the [latitude](#latitude) and [longitude](#longitude) below.

#### latitude
(`float`)<br>
The latitude given in decimal degrees. The latitude sets the North-bounding (top-left) coordinate.

#### longitude
(`float`)<br>
The longitude given in decimal degrees. The longitude sets the West-bounding (top-left) coordinate.

#### height
(`int`)<br>
The height of the screen in meters. This is not randomized if choosing a seed.

#### width
(`int`)<br>
The width of the screen in meters. This is not randomized if choosing a seed.

#### resolution
(`int`)<br>
The resolution of each pixel in meters. Data is measured in pixels corresponding to the resolution i.e: resolution = 30m x 30m = 1 pixel. This is not randomized if choosing a seed. The `area.pixel_scale` auto-scales to this resolution, i.e 30m ~= 98ft.

#### year
(`int`)<br>
The year of the fuel data. Current options are `2019`, `2020`, and `2022`. This is not randomized if choosing a seed.
